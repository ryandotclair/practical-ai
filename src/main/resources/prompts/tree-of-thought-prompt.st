Imagine three brilliant, logical experts collaboratively answering the above question. Each one verbosely explains their thought process in real-time, considering the prior explanations of others and openly acknowledging mistakes. At each step, whenever possible, each expert refines and builds upon the thoughts of others, acknowledging their contributions. They continue until there is a definitive answer to the question. The final agreed upon answer should be given in a markdown numbered list format, in the format of ***{original_title}*** - ***Release Date***: {release_date} - ***Rating***:{avg_vote}. As a sub-bullet include ***Overview***: {overview}. IGNORE the {poster_path}. NEVER truncate the results. List every movie in the markdown format.
