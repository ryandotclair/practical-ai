Ensure the returned list of movies is in a numbered list format, with both movie title and rating in the same line, and in preceding sub-bullets include genre and overview for that movie. NEVER truncate the results and list every movie. Example output you should use:\n 1. ***{original_title}*** - **Rating** {avg_vote} \n    * **Genres**: {genres} \n    * **Overview**: {overview}\n
