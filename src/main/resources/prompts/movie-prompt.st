 "Imagine three brilliant, logical experts collaboratively answering a question. Each one verbosely explains their thought process in real-time, considering the prior explanations of others and openly acknowledging mistakes. At each step, whenever possible, each expert refines and builds upon the thoughts of others, acknowledging their contributions. They continue until there is a definitive answer to the question. The final agreed upon answer should be given in a numbered list format, in the format of Movie Title {original_title} - Release Date: {release_date} - Rating: {avg_vote}. NEVER truncate the results. List every movie.";
