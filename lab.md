# Welcome

Welcome [NAME]!

This guide has been custom built to you, using Azure Spring App Enterprise's App Accelerator feature. Think of this feature as a templating engine that not only allows you to templatize all of your organization's best practices into ready-made "get of the ground and go" app templates, but also a method in sharing knowledge with your organization (like we're using it here). Have a service that you want other teams in your company to use? Why not give instructions, customized to them, with actual code examples?
