# Welcome

Welcome [NAME]!

This guide has been custom built to you, using Azure Spring App Enterprise's App Accelerator feature. Think of this feature as a templating engine that can not only templatize all of your organization's best practices into ready-made "get off the ground and github co-pilot from there" app templates, but also a method in sharing knowledge with your organization (like how we're using it here). Have a service that you want other teams in your company to use? Why not give instructions, customized to them, with actual code examples, published to the app accelerator portal! Everything is backed by git, so people can also contribute to it's content (hint, hint, PR's are welcomed!)

For our purposes we used your name (as a greeting) and the first 10 characters of your TMDB API token ([tmdbapi]) to create unique names to the various resources within Azure that require globally unique names (for DNS reasons).
